In this code we are using 5 souce file namely

l.h (in which definition of link list is present)

l.cpp (in which implementation of link list is present)

c.h (in which definition of complex class is present)

c.cpp (in which implementation of complex class is present)

main.cpp (which is our testing file)

In this code we first store three numbers in a link link list

Then we delete two numbers one by one from link list

Then we add first two numbers and place it in first place in link list

Then we subtract third number from first number and place it in last in a link list

Then we multiply 2nd and 3rd number and store it in last

Then we add first two numbers and place it in 4th position

Then we delete the numbers from 4th position.

Then we divide first and 3rd number and place it in 4th position

Then we ask the user about the position of anynumber

Then we show the number at that position
