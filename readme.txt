In this code we are using 5 souce file namely

1. l.h (in which definition of link list is present)

2. l.cpp (in which implementation of link list is present)

3. c.h (in which definition of complex class is present)

4. c.cpp (in which implementation of complex class is present)

5. main.cpp (which is our testing file)

6. In this code we first store three numbers in a link link list

7. Then we delete two numbers one by one from link list

8. Then we add first two numbers and place it in first place in link list

9. Then we subtract third number from first number and place it in last in a link list

10. Then we multiply 2nd and 3rd number and store it in last

11. Then we add first two numbers and place it in 4th position

12. Then we delete the numbers from 4th position.

13. Then we divide first and 3rd number and place it in 4th position

14. Then we ask the user about the position of anynumber

15. Then we show the number at that position
